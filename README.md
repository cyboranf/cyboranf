`Engineer (titles are bullshit - real engineering happens outside lecture halls)`

## üöÄ Current Reign
**CTO @ Next-Gen Memorial Empire**  
*Poland's largest death-tech ecosystem*  
- Virtual cemeteries 3.0 (with NFT grave markers)  
- AI-powered legacy avatars  
- IoT-integrated funeral services  

**CTO @Wizka-io**  
*Networking revolution*  
üÉè NFC-embedded premium business cards  
üåê Cloud-powered digital identity  
‚ôæÔ∏è Infinite supply for [JAZDA](https://jazda.io)  

## üî• Battle Scars
`Operation Academic Betrayal (2025)`  
- Forced AWS deployment by "security advisor"  
- 0-day via XSS on Knych.pl + sex@sex.com table entries  
- Verdict: *"Unworthy of engineer title"*  
- My counter: **Shipped anyway**

## ‚ò†Ô∏è Tech Manifesto  
```java
public void build() {
    while(!legacySystem.crushed()) {
        innovate();
        if (theorists.complaining()) ignore();
        ship();
    }
}
```
## üíÄ Coming Soon  

üîú Academic-industrial complex dismantling  
üîú New security standard: **Chaos-Driven Development**

## üìå Full Story Mode
### Why Titles Lie
- Survived university "cybersecurity" courses that taught:  
  ‚úñÔ∏è Theoretical OWASP > actual deployment security  
  ‚úñÔ∏è AWS best practices from professors who never shipped  
  ‚úñÔ∏è How to get 0wned by your own advisor

### How I Build
| Academia Preaches | Reality Demands |
|--------------------|------------------|
| Over-engineer docs | Working MVP NOW |  
| Follow standards   | Create standards |  
| Ask permission     | Ship, then fight |


``` java
public class Mission {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        while(true) {
            disrupt();
            innovate();
            if (haters.exist()) troll();
        }
    }
}
```
